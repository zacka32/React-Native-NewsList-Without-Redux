#### WARNING: react-native-router-flux v4 is in beta. Go [here](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux/tree/v3) for v3. Docs could be found [here](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux/blob/master/README3.md)

___

Define all your routes in one place...

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Router>
        <Scene key="root">
          <Scene key="login" component={Login} title="Login"/>
          <Scene key="register" component={Register} title="Register"/>
          <Scene key="home" component={Home}/>
        </Scene>
      </Router>
    );
  }
}
```

...and navigate from scene to scene with a simple, powerful API

```js
// login.js

// navigate to 'home' as defined in your top-level router
Actions.home(PARAMS)

// go back (i.e. pop the current screen off the nav stack)
Actions.pop()

// refresh the current Scene with the specified props
Actions.refresh({param1: 'hello', param2: 'world'})
```


## Try the example app

```bash
# Get the code
git clone git@github.com:aksonov/react-native-router-flux.git`
cd react-native-router-flux/Example

# Install dependencies
yarn

# Run it
react-native run-ios
```

## v4 Features
* Based on latest [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org) API
* Separate navigation logic from presentation. You may change now navigation state directly from your business logic code - stores/reducers/etc. navigationStore
* Built-in state machine (v3 `Switch` replacement) - each ‚Äòscene‚Äô could have onEnter/onExit handlers. onEnter handler could be async. For successful termination of onEnter, `success` handler (if defined) will be executed (if `success` is string then router will navigation to that Scene), in case of handler's failure `failure` (if defined) will be run. It will allow to build authentication, data validation and conditional transitions in very easy way.
* MobX-powered, all used scenes are wrapped as 'observer' automatically. You may subscribe to navigationStore (former Actions), observe current navigation state, etc. If you are using Redux, skip this.
* Flexible nav bar customization, that is not allowed by react navigation right now:
https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues/779
* Drawer support (provided by reactnavigation)
* Inheritance of scene attributes allow you to avoid any code/attribute duplications. If you send rightTitle it will be shown in all children.
* Access to your app navigations state as simple as `Actions.state`, use `Actions.currentScene` to get name of current scene.

## Breaking changes (compared to v3):
* `Actions.create` (alternative syntax to define scenes) is not available (for simplicity) - just use `<Router>` as top component for your App. You may wrap it with Redux as well.
* No duration/panHandlers support - you have to implement custom navigator now instead and pass it as ‚Äònavigator‚Äô prop:
https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigators/custom
* No `component` support for scene containers (that contains children `Scene`) - you have to use custom navigator
* No support for partial hiding of tab bar for some tabs because of react navigation bug (react navigation issue):
https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues/1584
* No possibility to skip animation during reset/replace (react navigation issue):
https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues/1493
* `Switch` is removed - you may use onEnter/onExit handlers for more flexible logic.
* `getSceneStyle` is removed (no needed in v4, you may pass any values to Router now and they will be inherited by all scenes).
* Custom reducer is supported (`createReducer` prop for Router) but Redux actions now are passed directly from React Navigation (‚ÄòNavigation/BACK‚Äô, ‚ÄòNavigation/NAVIGATE‚Äô, etc.)
* Drawer is 'drawer' attribute Scene
* Modal is 'lightbox' attribute for Scene (used for popups, like Error)
* No `position` attribute is supported for custom transitions. For vertical transition add `modal` to parent `Scene`.
* No flux 'focus' actions - use onEnter/onExit handlers instead.
* Possible other stuff.
